I have spent a sometime convincing myself to start a blog and in doing that I have stumbled upon good advice on
blogging. So I decided to publish a post each week to get my engines started. I am starting off by compiling a list of
links from people I follow/read their blogs on why you should blog.

## Jeff Atwood: [“How To Achieve Ultimate Blog Success In One Easy Step”](https://blog.codinghorror.com/how-to-achieve-ultimate-blog-success-in-one-easy-step/)

Jeff writes at [https://blog.codinghorror.com](https://blog.codinghorror.com/) which is one of my favourite blogs.

> When people ask me for advice on blogging, I always respond with yet another form of the same advice
> **pick a schedule you can live with, and _stick to it_. Until you do that, none of the other advice I could give
> you will matter.** I don't care if you [suck at writing](https://blog.codinghorror.com/fear-of-writing/).
> I don't care if [nobody reads your blog](https://blog.codinghorror.com/users-dont-care-about-you/). I don't care
> if you have [nothing interesting to say](https://blog.codinghorror.com/blogging-about-blogging/). If you can
> demonstrate a willingness to write, and a desire to keep continually improving your writing, you will eventually be successful.

## Ben Kuhn: [Writing](https://www.benkuhn.net/writing)

Ben Kuhn goes more in-depth on how and why you should blog.

> It’s easy to think that you have to put out really “interesting” writing in order for other people to like it.[3](https://www.benkuhn.net/writing/#fn:3)
> I think that’s true for going viral, but not true for having a blog that your friends enjoy reading,
> makes acquaintances feel more positively towards you, etc.
> ….
> As mentioned above, an important first step here is to lower your bar for what’s worth writing about.

## Alex Guezy: [Why You Should Start A Blog Right Now](https://guzey.com/personal/why-have-a-blog/)

> This fact is very frequently lost when discussing writing: **writing not only helps you to understand
> what’s going on and to crystallize your thoughts, it actually makes you think of new ideas and come
> up with solutions to your problems.**

## Steve Yegge: [You should write blogs](https://sites.google.com/site/steveyegge2/you-should-write-blogs)

> I've talked with a lot of people who are reluctant to write blogs. Everyone offers pretty much the same reasons:
> they're too busy, or they're afraid to put something on "permanent public record", or they think nobody will
> read their blog, or they think blogging is narcissistic. Or they're worried that they either don't have anything
> good to say, or they won't say it very well.
>
> I'm here to tell you that *none* of these reasons should stop you from writing in your blog.

## Julia Evans: [Write aboout what you've struggled with](https://jvns.ca/blog/2021/05/24/blog-about-what-you-ve-struggled-with/)

This is more about getting a sense of what to blog about, especially for programmers.
Notice the crease, parts that don’t make sense, delve deeper into them and write about them.

> The process I use for a lot of my blog posts is:
>
> 1. Struggle with something (usually computer-related)
> 2. Eventually (days or months or years later), figure out how to solve some of the problems I had
> 3. Write a blog post about what helped me

## David Perrell: [Why you should write](https://perell.com/essay/why-you-should-write):

Perrell’s not really into tech but has some good writing tips. He also runs an online writing school [Write of Passage](https://writeofpassage.school/):

> Words are the atomic unit of the internet.
> With the stroke of a pen, you can build your network, improve your thinking, and create opportunities for yourself.

## Seth Godin: [Write something](https://seths.blog/2021/09/write-something/)

Seth keeping it short and sweet, as always.

> There’s no such thing as writer’s block. There’s simply a fear of bad writing.
> Do enough bad writing and some good writing is bound to show up.

I am mostly writing this for myself, in case I occasionally need a reminder.
The core of the advice on these links is just to get started! More specifically, start writing(and publishing)
at a particular cadence online.

You know a lot of cool stuff, you should share them :).
